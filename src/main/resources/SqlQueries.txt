(1) Write MySQL query to find IPs that made more than a certain number of requests for a given time period.

	QUERY:
		 SELECT IP, COUNT(ID) FROM server_access_log WHERE server_access_time BETWEEN ? AND ? GROUP BY IP HAVING COUNT(ID) > ?
		
    Ex: Write SQL to find IPs that made more than 100 requests starting from 2017-01-01.13:00:00 to 2017-01-01.14:00:00.
		SELECT IP, COUNT(ID) FROM server_access_log  
									WHERE server_access_time BETWEEN '2017-01-01 13:00:00' AND '2017-01-01 14:00:00'
									GROUP BY IP 
									HAVING COUNT(ID) > 100
								
(2) Write MySQL query to find requests made by a given IP.
	QUERY:
		select * from server_access_log where ip=? order by serverAccessTime desc;	
		
	Ex: Write MySQL query to find requests made by 192.168.169.194 IP Address.
		select * from server_access_log where ip='192.168.169.194' order by server_access_time desc;
